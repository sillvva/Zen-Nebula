<h2 align="left">✨What is Nebula?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Nebula is a minimal theme made for Zen Browser which adds a lot of new animations, glass-like blur, UI changes, and more. It is inspired by glassmorphism and minimal gradients.<br><br>This is my personal userChrome which I made to personalize Zen to my own liking. ❤️<br>If some of you don't like the design choices I made, you can edit the userChrome yourself if you know how to code, and if you don't, you can use ChatGPT to customize it as per your preference.</p>

<h3 align="left">2. Customize Nebula through configs</h3>

###

- Nebula features a `Nebula-config.css` file inside the Nebula folder — it allows users to customize Nebula to their own liking!  
- Want to change/disable certain animations? You can do that as well by reading the clear instructions in the `Nebula-config.css` file.  
- There are lots of inbuilt mods which Nebula has baked in — for example, the `nogaps` mod removes the gap/border from the website window.  
- Here is a list of configs which you can change through `about:config`
- **Note:** If you are on Sine version of Nebula, you can click this settings icon on Nebula mod to change its preferences ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad610a8-fc19-454d-acd3-6eb325e11959)

<h3 align="left">4. Add the Firefox extension Bonjourrr</h3>

###

<p align="left">• Go to "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bonjourr-startpage/" and install this extension.<br><br>• The new tab must be replaced by this now. On the bottom right, you will see a settings button for new tab. Change the settings to these:</p>

|-|-|-|

###

<p align="left">• In the section where it says "Add custom CSS", add this code to change font of newtab and make it transparent:</p>

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comfortaa:wght@300&display=swap');

body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, span, div {
    font-family: 'Comfortaa', sans-serif !important;
    font-weight: 300 !important;
    letter-spacing: 0.015em;
    font-smooth: always;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
    transition: color 0.3s ease, text-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

/* Light mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, span, div {
        color: #222222;
        text-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    }
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, span, div {
        color: #e0e0e0;
        text-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    }
}

h1 {
    font-weight: 400 !important;
    letter-spacing: 0.025em;
}

p {
    font-weight: 300 !important;
    line-height: 1.6;
    letter-spacing: 0.015em;
}
#background {
    background-color: transparent !important;
}
#background {background-image: none !important; background-color: transparent !important;}
   .tabbing {background-color: transparent !important;} 
    body {background-color: transparent !important;}
#background-wrapper {
    opacity: 0 !important;
}
```

<h3 align="left">5.  Using pinned extensions</h3>

###

<p align="left">• First pin an extension normally, it should be somewhere in the top bar like default zen<br><br>• Now, right click on the sidebar and go to customize toolbar mode, from there drag the extension from the top bar to above essentials (or you can say below the URLbar) it would look a bit weird but press save changes and it should look perfect<br><br>• In my personal opinion, place the bonjourr extension above essentials so you can easily open a new tab by clicking it</p>

<div align="center">


<img height="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8121a9a4-e8ed-4c4e-8ed0-92bd775438bb" />

### 6. Add the extension [Zen Internet by Sameerasw](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zen-internet/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) (Optional)

> This extension makes web pages transparent

> [!NOTE]
> There might be some issues with this theme, please report them to me if you experience something unusual, i will try to fix/clarify it. Also this mod has only been tested by me on a windows 11 computer so if Linux and MacOS versions are not working properly then i can't really do anything about it :(
